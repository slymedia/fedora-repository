This is the bin directory. 

If you allow login's for the fedora user this user can run these scripts as:
start_fedora
stop_fedora

${REPOSITORY_HOME}/bin is how it's referenced and is already included in the environment
setup. So anything put in here and made executable will be able to be called without
using the full path to them. 

Also binaries that are compiled from software_dependancies.install are linked to this 
directory.
