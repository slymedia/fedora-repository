{"name":"Digital Repository","tagline":"Installation Framework for installing Fedora Commons Database Repository Server","body":"### Welcome to the Fedora Repository Server Installer.\r\nThis project is for installing [fedora commons](http://fedora-commons.org) on a CentOS 6 based server that's configured ready to be used with a Drupal based Islandora site. \r\n\r\n### What's installed\r\n\r\n#### Fedora Commons 3.8.1\r\n\r\nFedora Commons is the database server for managing Digital Collections. While you can browse objects directly within Fedora it's generally used for a backend storage configured against a web front end for presenting the objects (ie. Drupal and Islandora.)\r\n\r\n#### Solr 4.2.2\r\n\r\nSolr is the indexing service that's installed with Fedora Commons to be able to index objects in a collection and present those results when asked for in database searches. \r\n\r\n#### Fedora GSearch 2.6\r\n\r\nFedora Gsearch is another aspect of the fedora server that provides an interface to allow one to search through a fedora database. It works with solr to produce indexed lists of digital objects that are searched. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to get a hosted solution using this installation framework.
