{"name":"Digital Repository","tagline":"Installation Framework for installing Fedora Commons Database Repository Server","body":"### Welcome to the Fedora Repository Server Installer.\r\nThis project is for installing [fedora commons](http://fedora-commons.org) on a CentOS 6 based server that's configured ready to be used with a Drupal based Islandora site. \r\n\r\n### What's installed\r\n\r\n#### Fedora Commons 3.8.1\r\n\r\nFedora Commons is the database server for managing Digital Collections. While you can browse objects directly within Fedora it's generally used for a backend storage configured against a web front end for presenting the objects (ie. Drupal and Islandora.)\r\n\r\n#### Solr 4.2.2\r\n\r\nSolr is the indexing service that's installed with Fedora Commons to be able to index objects in a collection and present those results when asked for in database searches. \r\n\r\n#### Fedora GSearch 2.6\r\n\r\nFedora Gsearch is another aspect of the fedora server that provides an interface to allow one to search through a fedora database. It works with solr to produce indexed lists of digital objects that are searched. \r\n\r\n#### Adore Djatoka 1.1\r\n\r\ndjatoka is open source Java software that builds upon a rich set of APIs and libraries to provide a service framework for the dynamic dissemination of JPEG 2000 image files. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/djatoka/)\r\n\r\n#### MySQL 5\r\n\r\n\" MySQL is a freely available open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is the most popular language for adding, accessing and managing content in a database. It is most noted for its quick processing, proven reliability, ease and flexibility of use.\" (Google Search)\r\n\r\n#### Apache 2\r\n\r\n Apache is a freely available Web server that is distributed under an \"open source\" license. Version 2.0 runs on most UNIX-based operating systems (such as Linux, Solaris, Digital UNIX, and AIX), on other UNIX/POSIX-derived systems (such as Rhapsody, BeOS, and BS2000/OSD), on AmigaOS, and on Windows 2000.
