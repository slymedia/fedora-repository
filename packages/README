This is the packages directory. 

Initially this will be empty except for the Makefile. 

This is how we compile in source code software and integrate
it into the software stack. At inital install it does a few
packages like lame, tesseract, leptonica, fits. Each package 
has a config file stored in islandora/etc/packages. It looks 
something like this: 

#
## LAME installation
#
export PACKAGE_NAME=lame
export PACKAGE_VERSION=3.99.5
export PACKAGE_URL="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lame/files/lame/3.99/lame-3.99.5.tar.gz/download"
export PACKAGE_UNCOMPRESS="tar -zxvf "
export PACKAGE_TARFILE="lame-3.99.5.tar.gz"
export PACKAGE_DIR_UNCOMPRESSED=$PACKAGE_NAME-$PACKAGE_VERSION

If you place a file called <package-name>.package it will get built using the
above template to download and build the software. The general process for building
most software manually goes like this:

cd /opt/islandora/src
wget <URL to .tar.gz file of the software>
tar -zxvf package_name-package_version.tar.gz
cd package_name-package_version
./configure --prefix=/opt/islandora/packages/package_name-package_version
make
make install
cd /opt/islandora/packages/package_name-package_version/
cp ../Makefile .
../../sbin/create_package_makefile.sh
make install
