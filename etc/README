This is the etc directory. 

It holds most of the pre-configured config files used to do the installation. 

It also holds env.sh and database.sh which are used to declare 
the environement variables for scripts when needed. Most of the 
time only sourcing of env.sh is needed for the software to run. 
database.sh holds database and account info in case you need it 
for scripting and it's used in initally setting up the software
during the install.
